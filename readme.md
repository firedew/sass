# Firedew UI

This is a project I have started because I am missing a good css library for general informative websites.
There a loads of amazing frameworks out there but they all seem to fous on components for web applications, 
which is quite different from a website providing information and a good look.

The various components used here will be selected subjectively by me and will be inspired
by the amazing MIT licenced frameworks. To give credits where credits are due I will ensure
to mention for each component where it was based on.

Maybe some day you will read this and share my ideas. But even if it remains just me, this is my beginning.

## Stack
This project will consist of sass variables, mixins and components with customization as a basic requirement. 
To be imported individually as needed. I will provide an import containing everything for those who prefer to be lazy, but I don't recommend this.
It's much nicer towards your users if their website only ever downloads what is actually uses.

### Normalize
Using [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css]Normalize.css) to sync all browsers to same design and to fix common bugs.
